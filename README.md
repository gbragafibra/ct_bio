Want to better understand biological systems, or organisms. [Robert Rosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosen_(biologist)) had a very profound understanding, and as such I intend to get through the trilogy:

- Fundamentals of Measurement and Representation of Natural Systems (1978) (FM)
- Anticipatory Systems: Philosophical, Mathematical and Methodological Foundations (1985) (AS)
- Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life (1991) (LI)

which makes some use of category theory.

I have no pure math background, and so my approach will essentially be to learn as needed to understand the primary text. I will make use of the following resources, primarily:

- Category Theory for the Sciences by David Spivak
- [Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05316)

A further interest is based on possibly simulating autopoietic systems that happen to have closure to efficient causation, by the equivalence between Cartesian Closed Categories and λ-calculus; DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.12.012 .

Resources on constructed dynamical systems which make use of λ-calculus:

- Fontana, Walter. "Functional self-organization in complex systems." Pattern Formation in the Physical and Biological Sciences. CRC Press, 2018. 43-63.

- Fontana, W., Buss, L.W. “The arrival of the fittest”: Toward a theory of biological organization. Bltn Mathcal Biology 56, 1–64 (1994). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02458289

- Fontana, Walter, and Leo W. Buss. "The barrier of objects: From dynamical systems to bounded organizations." (1996).

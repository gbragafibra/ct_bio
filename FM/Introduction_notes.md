# Introduction - Notes

Deliniates the themes approached throughout the book, namely:

- The theory of measurement; what does it mean for a system to make a measurement?

- The theory of recognition; or more widely known as "pattern recognition" in the biological world.

- The theory of discrimination; or the specificity of interactions between systems.

- The theory of classification; or otherwise how we classify the phenomena we observe (be them about natural or formal systems).

This book more generally, tries to answer the following questions:

- What have we learned about a system when we have measured it, recognised it, classified it, or otherwise labeled it in a particular manner?

- How is this knowledge related to that obtained by different procedures for measurement, recognition or classification?

- What does it mean when we say that distinct systems, according to some criterion, nevertheless have the same label under another criterion (being indistinguishable under this one)?

- When does indistinguishability according to a certain mode of observation imply indistinguishability according to another?

The approach to these questions is resting on the assertion that every measurement, recognition, discrimination or classification depends on the capacity of a system $S$ to induce a dynamics (i.e. a state change) in a system $M$. Such system $M$ is denoted as a meter, discriminator, recognizer, etc. As such, given two systems $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, if they induce the same dynamics on $M$, they are indistinguishable to $M$, and can be said to share some element of organization in terms of which they can be considered alike.

Why deal with such epistemological matters, when we are simply dealing with biology? Rosen argues that these types of questions and problems are fundamental to every other type of problem that inevitably shows up.
